The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the northern borders of
China. The wall was constructed to protect against invasions and raids by nomadic tribes from the
north. The wall stretches over 13,000 miles, making it one of the longest man-made structures in the
world. It was originally built during the 7th century BC, but most of the existing wall dates back to the
Ming dynasty. The Great Wall is considered one of the most impressive architectural feats in human
history and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The theory of relativity, formulated by Albert Einstein, revolutionized our understanding of space,
time, and gravity. The theory consists of two parts: the special theory of relativity and the general
theory of relativity. Special relativity explains how time and space are interconnected and relative to
the observer's motion. General relativity, on the other hand, explains how gravity is a result of the
warping of spacetime around massive objects. These theories have been confirmed by numerous
experiments and observations, including the bending of light around the sun and the precise
measurement of atomic clocks in motion.
